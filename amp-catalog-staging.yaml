  - title: Automatic Text Summarization
    label: summarize
    short_description: Automatic text summarization with extractive and abstractive models.
    long_description: >-
      This project builds a Streamlit application that demos four automatic summarization models, including extractive and abstractive techniques.
      It facilitates qualitative and quantitative comparisons of model summaries, as well as allowing users to summarize their own input text.

  - title: Train Gensim's Word2Vec
    label: gensim-w2v
    short_description: Demonstration of how to train Gensim's Word2Vec for a non-language use case.
    long_description: >-
      This Jupyter Notebook project demonstrates how to train Word2Vec for a non-language  use case to learn embeddings for productcs on an e-commerce website. 
      Includes a demonstration of hyperparameter optimization and early stopping for the Word2Vec model.

  - title: TensorBoard as a CML Application
    label: tensorboard
    short_description: Demonstration of how to use TensorBoard as a CML Application.
    long_description: >-
      This project demonstrates how to run a TensorBoard dashboard as an application inside CML. To facilitate the demo, a minimal script is run to train a neural network
      on the MNIST digits data set while capturing logs that are visualized in the TensorBoard application.
