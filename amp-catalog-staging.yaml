  - title: Continuous Model Monitoring
    label: continuous-model-monitoring
    short_description: Demonstration of how to perform continuous model monitoring on CML using Model Metrics and Evidently.ai dashboards.
    long_description: >-
      To combat concept drift in production systems, its important to have robust monitoring capabilities that alert 
      stakeholders when relationships in the incoming data or model have changed. In this Applied Machine Learning 
      Prototype (AMP), we demonstrate how this can be achieved on CML. Specifically, we leverage CML's Model Metrics 
      feature in combination with Evidently.ai's Data Drift, Numerical Target Drift, and Regression Performance reports 
      to monitor a simulated production model that predicts housing prices over time.

  - title: NeuralQA
    label: neuralqa
    short_description: >-
      Launch a visual interface for question answering that supports BERT models and information retrieval methods.
    long_description: >-
      This project demonstrates how the Cloudera Fast Forward Labs NeuralQA
      library can be used to bootstrap an application for extractive question
      answering. The application interface integrates visualizations for
      explaining model behaviour and contextual query expansion.

  - title: TensorBoard as a CML Application
    label: tensorboard
    short_description: Demonstration of how to use TensorBoard as a CML Application.
    long_description: >-
      This project demonstrates how to run a TensorBoard dashboard as an application inside CML. To facilitate the demo, a minimal script is run to train a neural network
      on the MNIST digits data set while capturing logs that are visualized in the TensorBoard application.
