  - title: Deep Learning for Image Analysis
    label: image-analysis
    short_description: Build a semantic search application with deep learning models.
    long_description: >-
      This project demonstrates how to build a scalable semantic search solution
      on a dataset of images. Pretrained convolutional neural networks are used to
      extract semantically meaningful representations, which are then indexed
      using the FAISS library for scalable retrieval. Finally, the project
      launches an interactive visualization for exploring the quality of
      representations extracted using multiple model architectures.

  - title: Structural Time Series
    label: structural-time-series
    short_description: Applying a structural time series approach to California hourly electricity demand data.
    long_description: >-
      This project provides an example application of a structural approach to time series via 
      generalized additive models (with the Prophet library) to California hourly electricity demand 
      data. The primary output of this repository is a small application exposing a probablistic 
      forecast and interface for asking a probabilistic questions against it.
