  - title: Deep Learning for Image Analysis
    label: image-analysis
    short_description: Build a semantic search application with deep learning models.
    long_description: >-
      This project demonstrates how to build a scalable semantic search solution
      on a dataset of images. Pretrained convolutional neural networks are used to
      extract semantically meaningful representations, which are then indexed
      using the FAISS library for scalable retrieval. Finally, the project
      launches an interactive visualization for exploring the quality of
      representations extracted using multiple model architectures.

  - title: Deep Learning for Anomaly Detection
    label: anomaly-detection
    short_description: Apply modern, deep learning techniques for anomaly detection to identify network intrusions.
    long_description: >-
      This project includes implementations of several neural networks
      (Autoencoder, Variational Autoencoder, Bidirectional GAN, Sequence Models)

      Launch a visual interface for question answering that supports BERT models and information retrieval methods.
    long_description: >-
      This project demonstrates how the Cloudera Fast Forward Labs NeuralQA
      library can be used to bootstrap an application for extractive question
      answering. The application interface integrates visualizations for
      explaining model behaviour and contextual query expansion.

  - title: Structural Time Series
    label: structural-time-series
    short_description: Applying a structural time series approach to California hourly electricity demand data.
    long_description: >-
      This project provides an example application of a structural approach to time series via 
      generalized additive models (with the Prophet library) to California hourly electricity demand 
      data. The primary output of this repository is a small application exposing a probablistic 
      forecast and interface for asking a probabilistic questions against it.

  - title: Deep Learning for Question Answering
    label: question-answering
    short_description: Explore an emerging NLP capability with WikiQA, an automated question answering system built on top of Wikipedia.
    long_description: >-
      This project allows users to explore the task of question answering from several angles. First, users can interact with a real QA 
      system, in which open questions are answered with snippets found in Wikipedia articles. Next, users can explore an app that showcases 
      the types of models that make QA systems possible. Finally, users can learn and visualize the data structures required for training 
      and evaluating those models.

    short_description: Learn how to explain ML models using LIME and SHAP.
    long_description: >-
      This projects provides a notebook on how to explain machine learning models using tools such as SHAP and LIME. It explores 
      concepts such as global and local explanations, illustrated with six different models - Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, 
      Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Tree, and a Multilayer Perceptron. It also discusses best practices for debugging 
      explanations as well as limitations of LIME and SHAP.

    short_description: Interactive visual workflow of active learning using the MNIST dataset.
    long_description: >-
      Supervised machine learning, while powerful, needs labeled data to be effective. Active learning reduces the number of labeled examples 
      needed to train a model, saving time and money while obtaining comparable performance to models trained with much more data.This application 
      demonstrates the active learning workflow in an interactive experience.
