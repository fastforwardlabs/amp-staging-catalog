    label: video-classification
    short_description: Demonstration of how to perform video classification using pre-trained TensorFlow models.
    long_description: >-
      This project provides a Jupyter Notebook walkthrough of video classification/action recognition with a 
      pre-trained Tensorflow model and provides guidance for working with video data.  The project also includes 
      a script that demonstrates how to perform larger-scale model inference.

  - title: Continuous Model Monitoring
    label: continuous-model-monitoring
    short_description: Demonstration of how to perform continuous model monitoring on CML using Model Metrics and Evidently.ai dashboards.
    long_description: >-
      To combat concept drift in production systems, its important to have robust monitoring capabilities that alert 
      stakeholders when relationships in the incoming data or model have changed. In this Applied Machine Learning 
      Prototype (AMP), we demonstrate how this can be achieved on CML. Specifically, we leverage CML's Model Metrics 
      feature in combination with Evidently.ai's Data Drift, Numerical Target Drift, and Regression Performance reports 
      to monitor a simulated production model that predicts housing prices over time.
