  - title: Streamlit
    label: streamlit
    short_description: Demonstration of how to use Streamlit as a CML Application.
    long_description: >-
      This project demonstrates running a small Streamlit application inside CML. It does no machine learning, and simply illustrates the small
      amount of wiring necessary to create a CML Application using Streamlit.

  - title: Object Detection Inference Visualized
    label: object-detection-inference
    short_description: Interact with a blog-style Streamlit application to visually unpack the inference workflow of a modern, single-stage object detector.
    long_description: >-
      This application offers a step-by-step walkthrough to help visualize the inference workflow of a single-stage object detector. Specifically,
      we'll see how a pre-trained RetinaNet model processes an image to quickly and accurately detect objects while also exploring fundamental object 
      detection concepts along the way.

  - title: Getting Started with the CML API
    label: apiv2
    short_description: Demonstration of how to use the CML API to interact with CML.
    long_description: >-
      In addition to the UI interface, Cloudera Machine Learning (CML) provides an API to interact with the platform programmatically. This notebook 
      demonstrates how to work with the API.

  - title: Few-Shot Text Classification
    label: fewshot-text-classification
    short_description: Perform topic classification on news articles in several limited-labeled data regimes.
    long_description: >-
      This project provides a sample user interface that demonstrates how to perform text classification when only a few labeled training 
      examples exist, or even when there are no training examples at all! The approach relies on embedding text using word embeddings and 
      sentence embeddings with state-of-the-art Transformer models.
