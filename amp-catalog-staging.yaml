    short_description: Demonstration of how to use the CML API to interact with CML.
    long_description: >-
      In addition to the UI interface, Cloudera Machine Learning (CML) provides an API to interact with the
      platform programmatically. This notebook demonstrates how to work with the API.

  - title: TensorBoard as a CML Application
    label: tensorboard
    short_description: Demonstration of how to use TensorBoard as a CML Application.
    long_description: >-
      This project demonstrates how to run a TensorBoard dashboard as an application inside CML. To facilitate 
      the demo, a minimal script is run to train a neural network on the MNIST digits data set while capturing 
      logs that are visualized in the TensorBoard application.

  - title: Summarize.
    label: summarize
    short_description: Automatic text summarization with extractive and abstractive models.
    long_description: >-
      This project builds a Streamlit application that demos four automatic summarization models, including 
      extractive and abstractive techniques. It facilitates qualitative and quantitative comparisons of model 
      summaries, as well as allowing users to summarize their own input text.
