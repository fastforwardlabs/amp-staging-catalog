  - title: Distributed XGBoost with Dask on CML
    label: dask-on-cml
    short_description: How to perform distributed training of an XGBoost model using Dask on CML.
    long_description: >-
      This project provides a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates a typical data science workflow for detecting fraudulent credit card 
      transactions by training a distributed XGBoost model in conjunction with Dask, a library for scaling Python applications, using the CML Workers API.

  - title: Exploring Intelligent Writing Assistance
    label: intelligent-writing-assistance
    short_description: A demonstration of how the NLP task of text style transfer can be applied to enhance the human writing experience using HuggingFace Transformers and Streamlit.
    long_description: >-
      The goal of this application is to demonstrate how the NLP task of text style transfer can be applied to enhance the human writing experience. In this sense, 
      we intend to peel back the curtains on how an intelligent writing assistant might function â€” walking through the logical steps needed to automatically re-style a piece of text 
      (from informal-to-formal or subjective-to-neutral) while building up confidence in the model output.
