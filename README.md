# AMP Staging Catalog

This repository acts as a staging environment for newly developed and reviewed AMPs to be automatically tested across all CML/CDSW form factors on a weekly basis. After successfully passing tests on all form factors, AMPs should be removed from this repo's catalog file and promoted to [Cloudera's default catalog](https://github.com/cloudera/Applied-ML-Prototypes).
